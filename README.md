# KeepMeBusy
This is going to be a react-native application that simply keeps track of things I'd like to do. When I'm bored I can go on here and click a button and a random item will be chosen.

Features:
- Items will be preset by user, also a general list will be created for users to pick from on initial setup.
- Timer for each item on the list.
- Notes for each item on the list.
- Should look like a spin wheel on the front screen initially.
